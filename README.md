# odin-rock-paper-scissors

Practice new DOM manipulation skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

With this project, the goal is to illustrate my understanding of manipulating DOM elements to change the content displayed on a webpage by creating a Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

I obtained a color scheme using a color scheme generator and added a gray color for an even lighter tone. I found images with creative commons licenses to be used within the buttons, which were made large for easy clickability. I also used CSS to change the color of the buttons when they are hovered over.

Probably my most notable addition to this project was the DOM manipulation. One was an animation at the top of the screen that displayed "Rock", "Paper", "Scissors", "Shoot!" separately and before each round is played. DOM manipulation is also used to change the scores and the messages displayed at the bottom of the screen
